# Auto Preset

## About
Auto Preset enables scriptable configuration of assets from the Unity Editor without requiring any additional code.

## Overview
`AutoPresetConfig` is a simple Scriptable Object derived class that holds a reference to a native Unity `Preset` asset; these assets can be created from any native Unity asset or component, containing the serialized settings of that asset in a dedicated Scriptable Object. Any asset imported in the same folder as a `AutoPresetConfig` asset(s) will check to see if any of them apply to that type of asset. If they do, the first applicable `AutoPresetConfig` asset found will automatically be applied to that newly imported asset.

## Importing AutoPresets
Using this library in your project can be done in two ways:
* **Releases:** The latest release can be found [here](https://github.com/jeffcampbellmakesgames/unity-auto-preset/releases) as a UnityPackage file that can be downloaded and imported directly into your project's Assets folder.
* **Package:** Using the native Unity Package Manager, you can add this library as a package by modifying your `manifest.json` file found at `/ProjectName/Packages/manifest.json` to include it as a dependency. See the example below on how to reference it.

```
{
	"dependencies": {
		...
		"com.jeffcampbellmakesgames.autopresets": "https://github.com/zapdot/unity-auto-preset.git#release/stable",
		...
	}
}
``` 

## Use-Cases and Usage
This type of automatic, scriptable configuration of assets can be used to reduce the boilerplate, often tedious work of configuring newly imported assets and can prevent errors from doing so manually. 

For example, a group of textures may require specific compression settings and properties in order to be rendered without artifacts by a shader. This may require manual tweaking to elicit what those settings are and apply them manually from that point on, requiring time and energy to make sure all of the settings are correct for any new textures and inviting human error.

### Creating a AutoPresetConfig

Instead, follow these steps to have those settings applied automatically every time a texture is imported into a specific folder.

* Configure one texture using the proper settings and save those settings as a `Preset` by clicking the dial icon at the top right of its inspector. This allows you to save those settings as a `Preset`.

* Create a `AutoPresetConfig` asset in that folder by right-clicking on the folder in the project view and selecting `Create=>JCMG=>AutoPreset=>AutoPresetConfig` and give it an appropriate name.

* Assign that newly created `Preset` asset to the `AutoPresetConfig` in its inspector.

### Manually Triggering Asset Updates
It may be convenient at times to update a `Preset` and apply any changes made to any assets that would be affected by it manually. There are two ways to do this:

* Right-click the `Preset` and select the menu-item `AutoPresets=>Reimport linked assets`. This will find any `AutoPresetConfig` instances in the project that reference that `Preset` and reimport any applicable assets. 
* Select a specific `AutoPresetConfig` asset in the project and select the `Reimport linked assets` button underneath `Actions`. This will reimport any applicable assets in the same folder.


### Supported Asset Types
You can use AutoPresets to automatically configure any of the supported asset types below:

* Textures
* AudioClips
* Materials
* Cubemaps
* Animations
* Assemblies/Plugins
* Models
* SpeedTree
* Any other Unity or custom assets that can generate a `Preset`.
